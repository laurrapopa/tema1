## How to clone GIT Repo

I've made a short GIF highlighting the steps needed to clone the repo.
Once the cloning steps are done, you can open the project in Intellij.

Steps are:
- Click on the "Code" button
  
- Copy the HTTPS link

- On your PC, go to the desired location and right click -> Show more options -> Git Bash Here
  
- In the command line that opens enter the following command: `$ git clone <Shift + Insert to paste the URL copied on stape 2> `

## How to link local repo to Github
- Open Fork and click on File -> Open Repository...

- Select the folder from where you cloned it / downloaded it previously

### Fetch & Pull the latest changes from GitHub

- Make sure that you perform a **Fetch** before **Pull**, otherwise the newest changes will not be pulled.

- Make sure you select the <font color="lightblue">Stash and reapply local changes</font> before clicking the **Pull** button.
